Battleship Game for Myers

Instructions
Battleship is a two player game in which each player first places a set amount of pieces in a 10x10 grid. In this implementation, the player is not limited to how big or how many ships he can have, only to how many spaces he can have. We have set this limit to 17. After the set-up stage, each player takes turns "shooting" at a space on the grid. If the player hits a spot the other player has claimed, then he can shoot again. If the player misses, then his turn is over and the other player's turn begins. The game ends when one player loses all of his lives.

Interface
The interface is fairly simple, just follow the buttons, and click on the grid in order to play the game.

Extra Features
Implemented a counter feature that auto-updates every time a player selects a spot on the grid.

Work Load

The work load was split up evenly among partners.
Scott mostly handled the GUI component of the game. This included creating Background pictures and images for the buttons and menu icons. 
Carlito implemented incredibly helpful features that helped the flow of the game immensely. This includes a BoardButton class that is called every time a player wishes to make a move.

Below are some of the links we used as references and pictures to create our game.
